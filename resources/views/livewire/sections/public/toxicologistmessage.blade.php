                We live in a toxic world, and poisoning remains an important global issue. To address this problem, poison centers have been established worldwide as specialized units dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and management of poisoning cases. In the Philippines, the National Poison Management and Control Center (NPMCC) was established at the University of the Philippines Manila â€“ Philippine General Hospital as the country's first poison center. Regional poison centers or poison treatment units were subsequently established under the Philippine Department of Health in different parts of the country to cater to the varying poisoning epidemiology across regions, with a focus on patient care services.<br /><br />

                However, apart from the NPMCC in the National Capital Region, there are no other university-based poison centers in the country specializing in research and innovation. Hence, the idea of establishing another university-based Poison Control Center with unique capabilities emerged. The West Visayas State University, renowned for its excellence in learning and research, equipped with a College of Medicine and its own teaching and training tertiary care medical center, is well-suited to fulfill this purpose. Initially, the center will begin as a poison information center. In its early stages, it aims to collaborate with relevant agencies, particularly the NPMCC, to develop its services.<br /><br />

                The functions of a poison center encompass various aspects, including poison information service, which provides accurate and timely information to healthcare professionals and the public. Additionally, clinical toxicology services offer appropriate management for poisoned patients, analytical laboratory services, toxicovigilance, education for poisoning prevention, teaching and training, and research. The West Visayas State University Poison Control Center will gradually expand its services, incorporating the clinical toxicology unit within the medical center and other relevant services. By doing so, it aspires to become an internationally-recognized academic, community, and research-oriented national poison center by 2030.<br /><br />

                Throughout its development, the center will adhere to the standards set by the World Health Organization, while fostering strong collaboration with all stakeholders, particularly those who pioneered the field of Toxicology in the country. The launch of this website marks only the beginning of many future endeavors to come.
